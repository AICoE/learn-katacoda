We need to generate some test data for Prometheus which can take a couple of minutes.

Once the environment is set up,

The Prometheus console can be accessed using the following url:

http://prometheus-demo-route-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

![Prometheus Console](./prometheus-api-client/assets/02-prometheus-console.png)

The jupyter environment with the workshop notebooks is available here:

http://prometheus-anomaly-detection-workshop-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

You will need a password to access the environment.
The password is `secret`{{copy}}

There are 2 notebooks available in the Jupyter environment:
1. `(Exercises) Introduction_Prometheus_API_Client.ipynb` - In this notebook you will explore and solve few exercises on using the Prometheus API client.
2. `(Solutions) Introduction_Prometheus_API_Client.ipynb` - You will find the solutions to the exercises in this notebook.
